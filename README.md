Installation and Getting Started
The reference documentation includes detailed installation instructions as well as a comprehensive getting started guide.

Here is a quick teaser of a complete Spring Boot application in Java:

import org.springframework.boot.*;
import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.*;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.*;

@RestController
@SpringBootApplication
public class Example {

	@RequestMapping("/")
	String home() {
		return "Hello World!";
	}

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		SpringApplication.run(Example.class, args);
	}

}


Building from Source
You don’t need to build from source to use Spring Boot (binaries in repo.spring.io), but if you want to try out the latest and greatest, Spring Boot can be easily built with the maven wrapper. You also need JDK 1.8.

$ ./mvnw clean install
If you want to build with the regular mvn command, you will need Maven v3.5.0 or above.


Building reference documentation
First of all, make sure you have built the project:

$ ./mvnw clean install
The reference documentation requires the documentation of the Maven plugin to be available so you need to build that first since it’s not generated by default.

$ ./mvnw clean install -pl spring-boot-project/spring-boot-tools/spring-boot-maven-plugin -Pdefault,full
The documentation also includes auto-generated information about the starters. You might have that in your local repository already (per the first step) but if you want to refresh it:

$ ./mvnw clean install -f spring-boot-project/spring-boot-starters
Once this is done, you can build the reference documentation with the command below:

$ ./mvnw clean prepare-package -pl spring-boot-project/spring-boot-docs -Pdefault,full
